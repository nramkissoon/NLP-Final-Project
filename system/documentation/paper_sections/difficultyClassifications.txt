Because the system will be classifying text based on reading difficulty from the point of view of a non-native speaker,
it will follow the standard of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT). The JLPT is widely considered to be the standard 
of Japanese language proficiency examinations and is often used by Japanese companies for hiring foreigners and the Japanese government
for immigration purposes. The JLPT has 5 different difficulty levels, N5 through N1, N5 being the easiest and N1 being the most advanced.
For more context, attaining N5 can be approximated to one semester college course in beginner Japanese, and attaining N1 suggests the ability to
consume and understand native-level materials.

Because the task is simply a text classification problem with 5 classes, the evaluation metric for the proposed 
system will be accuracy. Specifically, overall accuracy is calculated as the total number of correctly classified documents divided by the 
total number of documents being tested. Another accuracy metric, adjacent-level accuracy, will be used as a metric with looser restrictions on what is 
considered a correct classification. Adjacent-level accuracy will define a correct classification as one where the classification is
within 1 level of the true classification (i.e. a classification of 2 or 4 will be considered correct if the true classification is 3). 
Depending on the use case, classifying text into 5 distinct JLPT levels may be too granular, and a system that effectively predicts
a ballpark figure of the difficulty level could suffice. 

In Table ****DEFINE****, the overall and adjacent-level accuracies of each of the baselines and main system are provided.
